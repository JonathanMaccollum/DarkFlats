![NGC 4725](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/NGC4725.Draft5b.Web.jpg "NGC 4725")

It's galaxy season again! Orion is setting in the west early and we get a view of the many distant worlds outside of our own Milky Way galaxy here in the springtime.  Here we see a group of interacting galaxies that was shot over five nights in April, pointing at the constellation of Coma Berenices.  The main galaxies here are designated NGC4725 (The largest here), NGC4747 (The one in the upper left with the extended arms formed by tidal interactions with NGC4725) and the more distant NGC4712 (Smaller one to the right of NGC4747.)
