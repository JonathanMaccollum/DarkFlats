This summer I took some extra time to take a second attempt at imaging the Wolf Rayet nebula in Cygnus, one of my favorite Oxygen targets in the summer sky.  This blue shell of oxygen is illuminated by the a surge of solar radiation and wind from the WR134 variable star.  Most of the oxygen in this area of the Milky Way is soft and dispersed so I am always intrigued when there are more dynamic factors that push these gases around to form interesting arc-like and circular shapes with sharp edges.  As a favorite, I'm sure I'll be revisiting this region many more times to come.
