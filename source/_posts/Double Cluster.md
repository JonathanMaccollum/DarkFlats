During the last full moon I decided to try to shoot Double Cluster in Perseus. I last shot this [in 2018](https://www.astrobin.com/full/368685/0/) so this image represents a little over two years worth of learning this hobby. I ended up with a slight light-leak gradient in the resulting data set, so took another hour of data last night before the moon came up and used it as a background reference using a multiscale gradient removal technique documented [here](https://pixinsight.com/tutorials/multiscale-gradient-correction/).
