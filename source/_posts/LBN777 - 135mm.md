After over a year attempting to shoot this region I've finally completed a revision of the dark molecular clouds that cover the taurus region near the Pleiades.  This is but one panel of a larger 8-panel mosaic that I've planned and hope to complete before summer gets here.  But this region in particular is one that I am a huge fan of.  it is home to the very popular and bright star cluster M45 the Pleiades that sits behind the molecular cloud, but it's radience shines through the dust.  Through the dust structures one can find LBN777, a "ghost like" molecular cloud that to my eyes looks like it's about to eat that bright yellow nearby star is more commonly known as the Vulture Nebula or Baby Eagle Nebula.
