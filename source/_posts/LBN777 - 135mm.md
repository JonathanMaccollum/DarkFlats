Equipment: 

* Celestron CGEM Mount

    * Self tuned / hacks to get guiding stable include:

    * Intentional offset polar alignment so dec always pulses in one direction
    
    * Balance "west" heavy (rather than the recommended east) so that the ota "falls" onto the gear teeth rather than get "lifted"
    
    * Factor Reset hand-controller daily (to prevent cgem from being possessed and forgetting where the meridian is on subsequent night)
    
    * Dither in RA only

* Rokinon 135mm f2 at f2

* asi071mc PRO at -15 C

* Astronomiks L3 UV/IR filter

* Widefield Rig + AF3 by Deep Sky Dad

Acquisition:

* 123x120s at unity gain (4 hours)

All pre-processing and post-processing was done in PixInsight and final touches added with Affinity photo. Full details below.



The resulting image is a combination of the following steps:

* Inspected all subs for bad images with Blink, discarding subs containing clouds

* Calibrated all subs with a master flat and master dark

* Used subframe selector to weight all images based on the following weighting

```C

 (10*(1-(FWHM-FWHMMin)/(FWHMMax-FWHMMin))

+ 20*(1-(Eccentricity-EccentricityMin)/(EccentricityMax-EccentricityMin))

+ 30*(1-(Median-MedianMin)/(MedianMax-MedianMin))

+ 10*(SNRWeight-SNRWeightMin)/(SNRWeightMax-SNRWeightMin)

+ 10*(Stars-StarsMin)/(StarsMax-StarsMin))

+ 30

```

* Selected the best sub from subframe and blink to use as a reference frame for aligning and integration

* Cropped the stacking edges of the integrated image

* Dynamic Background Extraction

    * ![DBE](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step02.DBE.PNG)

* Background Neutralization using 5 small preview windows aggregated as a background reference

* Color Calibration |> Solved |> Photometric Color Calibration
    * ![Color Calibrated with Linked Screen Transfer Function](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step03.PCC.PNG)

* RGBWorking Space to 1,1,1

* Noise Reduction was done using TGV Denoise with a low contrast mask and an autostretched local support and MMT with a very protective luminance mask
    * ![Noise Reduction Applied](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step04.NR.PNG)

* Stretched using Arcsinh Stretch followed by Masked Stretch

    * ![Subsequent Stretch with MaskedStretch](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step06.MS.PNG)

Luminance Processing

* A synthetic luminance was extracted prior to the stetching of the RGB data for separating luminance processing ``L``
    * ![Extracted Luminance with Screen Transfer Function](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step07.L.STF.PNG)

* Stretched using Masked Stretch and Histogram Transformation
    * ![Masked Stretch with Histogram](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step08.L.MS.PNG)

* Created a ``Starless`` version of the luminance using [starnet++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/starnet/) and a **StarsOnly** image by subtracting the starless from the luminance ``Starless-L``
    * ![Starnet++ Starless](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step09.L.StarNet.PNG)

* Performed two rounds of Local Histogram Equalization on the starless image

    * Kernel Radius 128 | Contrast 4 | Amount 0.100 | 8-bit | Circular
    * ![Local Histogram Equalization - First Pass](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step10.L.LHE.PNG)

    * Kernel Radius 256 | Contrast 8 | Amount 0.030 | 8-bit | Circular
    * ![Local Histogram Equalization - Second Pass](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step11.L.LHE2.PNG)

* Performed large scale sharpening and noise reduction with Multiscale Linear Transformation 6 levels 
    * ![Multiscale Linear Transformation](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step12.L.MLT.PNG)

* Recombined the enhanced Starless with the Stars only image with Pixel Math ``Starless+StarsOnly``
    * ![Enhanced Starless + StarsOnly](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step13.L.RecombineStars.PNG)


Bringing the Enhanced Details back into the Color Data and Final Steps

* Used ChannelCombination in CIE L\*A\*B mode to apply Luminance to Color
    * ![RGB + Enhanced L](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step14.LRGB.PNG)

* Stars in this image were reduced by using two rounds of morphological selection with a contours based mask created with the following steps:

    * Extract a new luminance from the color image

    * Apply the following pixel math expression to a new extracted luminance to create a contours version using the ``StarsOnly`` image created earlier: ``StarsOnly/$T-$T``

    * ![Morphological Selection with Contours Mask](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step15.MT.PNG)

* Curves transformation was used to increase contrast and saturation with a luminance mask
    * ![Contrast and Saturation Curves](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step16.Curves.PNG)

* Over saturated stars were magenta and were fixed by inverting and applying SCNR green before re-inverting
    * ![SCNR Magenta](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step17.SCNR_Mg.PNG)

* An ICC Profile was applied to enable Black Point Compensation

* The image was exported as a 16bit TIFF file and loaded into Affinity Photo

* Final round of noise reduction was applied with Affinity

* HSL enhancements were applied to shift the dust colors to emphasize their golden brown color

    * ![Final Tweaks with Affinity Photo](/Widefield/Taurus/P3.Step19.AffinityHSL.NR.PNG)

* The final image from Affinity Photo and the final image from PixInsight was blended together to ensure a more natural reduction of noise levels
