All pre-processing and post-processing was done in PixInsight. Full details below.

The resulting image is a combination of the following steps:

* Inspected all subs for bad images with Blink, discarding subs containing clouds

* Calibrated all subs with their corresponding master flat and master dark

* Used sub-frame selector to weight all images based on the following weighting

```C

    -ApprovalExpression "FWHM<4.5 && Eccentricity<0.65"

    -WeightingExpression "(15*(1-(FWHM-FWHMMin)/(FWHMMax-FWHMMin))

    +  5*(1-(Eccentricity-EccentricityMin)/(EccentricityMax-EccentricityMin))

    + 15*(SNRWeight-SNRWeightMin)/(SNRWeightMax-SNRWeightMin)

    + 30*(1-(Median-MedianMin)/(MedianMax-MedianMin))

    + 20*(Stars-StarsMin)/(StarsMax-StarsMin))

    + 20" 

```

* Selected the best sub from sub-frame selector and blink to use as a reference frame for aligning and integration

* All subs of each filter were aligned to the same reference frame using the Star Alignment process

* Integrated all Red frames together, Blue frames together, Green frames together, IR frames together and L3 frames together to create masters for each filter. 

* Cropped the stacking edges of the integrated masters


[Luminance Processing]

* A super luminance was created by stacking everything except the IR data together and used as the luminance channel when processing the image. The IR data was intentionally omitted as there was a large amount of microlensing that showed up in the IR stack. It turns out the 268m has a micro-lensing issue in infrared.

* Dynamic Background Extraction was applied to remove gradients throughout the field

* Independently produce a separate noise reduced image and a sharpened image while still in the linear state

   * Noise Reduction was done using TGV Denoise with a low contrast mask and an auto-stretched local support and MMT with a very protective luminance mask

    * ![Settings](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/SyntheticLum.02.Settings.jpg)

   * Deconvolution was done on a separate copy of the luminance with

        * Deringing using Global Dark, Global Bright, and an auto-stretched copy of the image as local support

        * Wavelet regularization with 5 layers and strong but reducing amounts/thresholds

    * ![Settings](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/SyntheticLum.01.Settings.jpg)

* The noise reduced copy and the sharpened copy were combined using a luminance-based mask where the high-signal areas were filled in from the deconvolution copy and the low-signal areas were filled in from the noise reduction copy ``Decon*CombineMask+NR*~CombineMask``

[Stretching to Non-Linear]

* Two different stretching techniques were used to take the image non-linear. One that used an aggressive series of Masked Stretch, and another that used Histogram Transformation, both careful to avoid clipping any pixel data.  These two stretched copies of the image were blended together using PixelMath and a mask to take the fainter background regions from the Masked Stretched image with the highlights of the Histogram Transformation process. The fainter background regions were enhanced using Power of Inverted Pixels, and then local contrast was enhanced using Local Histogram Equalization.

[RGB Processing]

* Channel combination to combine the integrated Red, Green and Blue masters into a color image

* Dynamic Background Extraction

    * ![Align/Combine/Crop/DBE](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.00.Align.Combine.Crop.jpg)

* Background Neutralization using 4 small preview windows aggregated as a background reference

    * ![Background Neutralization](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.01.BackgroundNeutralization.jpg)

* The image was solved and color calibrated using Photometric Color Calibration using ``Sb Galaxy`` as the white reference
    
    * ![Photometric Color Calibration](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.02.PCC.jpg)

* The RGB Working mode was set to equalize all colors 1:1, then the color of the blown-out star cores were filled using the HSV Repaired Separation Script and Channel Combination in HSV mode.
    
    * ![HSV Repaired Separation](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.03.RGBWS.HSVRS.jpg)

* Noise Reduction was done using TGVDenoise with a low contrast mask and an auto-stretched local support, SCNR to remove the green overcast and MMT with a very protective luminance mask as documented by [Jon Rista](https://jonrista.com/the-astrophotographers-guide/pixinsights/effective-noise-reduction-part-2/) 

    * ![TGV Denoise > MMT Noise Reduction](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.04.TGVMMTNR.jpg)

* Stretching to nonlinear was done using ArcSinh Stretch and Masked Stretch. Histogram transformation was used to bring the tail in after each pass.

    * ![ArcSinh Stretch > Masked Stretch](/Deep-Sky/NGC4725/RGB.05.ArcSinh.MaskedStretch.jpg)

* Saturation of the galaxies and stars were boosted with a C curve and saturation of the background was reduced using curves.

* Additional round of chrominance noise reduction using ATrousWaveletTransform targetting the small scale wavelet layers
