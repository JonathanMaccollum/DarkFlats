Ursa Major is full of exciting galaxies to see.  This image contains a galaxy called NGC3718 (lower center of image) that was likely warped by the smaller barred spiral galaxy NGC3729 (top center of the image).  Just to the left of NGC3718 is a chain of 5 distant galaxies commonly known as the Hickson Compact Group 56.  Throughout the field are a great many smaller galaxies.

I find myself in awe as I look through the data as the camera brings it in from the telescope in the backyard, and am completely blown away by all the details that can be seen in these galaxies though their light shines from so far away and so long ago.

Equipment: 

* Orion 8in F4.9 1000mm Newtonian Reflector

   * Flocked / Primary mirror replaced due to turned-down-edge

* Skywatcher F4 Aplanatic Coma Corrector

* Astrodon E Series L, R, G, B  broadband filters

* Celestron CGEM Mount

    * Self tuned / hacks to get guiding stable include:

    * Intentional offset polar alignment so dec always pulses in one direction
    
    * Balance "west" heavy (rather than the recommended east) so that the ota "falls" onto the gear teeth rather than get "lifted"
    
    * Factory Reset hand-controller daily (to prevent cgem from being possessed and forgetting where the meridian is on subsequent night)
    
    * Dither in RA only

All pre-processing and post-processing was done in PixInsight. Full details below.

The resulting image is a combination of the following steps:

* Inspected all subs for bad images with Blink, discarding subs containing clouds

* Calibrated all subs with their corresponding master flat and master dark

* Used subframe selector to weight all images based on the following weighting

```C

    -ApprovalExpression "FWHM<4.5 && Eccentricity<0.65"

    -WeightingExpression "(5*(1-(FWHM-FWHMMin)/(FWHMMax-FWHMMin))

    + 15*(1-(Eccentricity-EccentricityMin)/(EccentricityMax-EccentricityMin))
    
    + 15*(SNRWeight-SNRWeightMin)/(SNRWeightMax-SNRWeightMin)
    
    + 20*(Stars-StarsMin)/(StarsMax-StarsMin))
    
    + 30" 

```

* Selected the best sub from subframe and blink to use as a reference frame for aligning and integration

Breakdown of approved subs after Blink/Subframe Selector:

* RGBWorking Space to 1,1,1

* Noise Reduction was done using TGV Denoise with a low contrast mask and an autostretched local support, SCNR to remove the green overcast and MMT with a very protective luminance mask as documented by [Jon Rista](https://jonrista.com/the-astrophotographers-guide/pixinsights/effective-noise-reduction-part-2/) An additional round of DBE was used to remove newly discovered color gradients through the noise reduction process.

    ![MMT Denoise](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step5.MMT.PNG)

    ![SCNR Green](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step6.SCNR.PNG)

* Saturated star cores were repaired using the HSV Repaired Separation script and recombined using HSV with Channel Combination

* An initial stretched using Arcsinh Stretch followed by Masked Stretch

    ![Arcsinh Stretch](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step7.ArcsinhStretch.PNG)

    ![Masked Stretch](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step8.MaskedStretch.PNG)

* Additional noise reduction using MMT, ACDNR was applied

    ![MMT Denoise](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step9.MMT.PNG)


* A final histogram curve and a masked C-Curve was applied to push the color data.

    ![Histogram, C-Curve Enhance](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/Step10.ContrastAndSaturation.PNG)

* A contours based star mask was created and morphological selection used to reduced the overall size and intensity of the medium and larger sized stars

* The RGB image was placed asside for Luminance Processing Next

[Luminance Processing]

* All approved L, R, G and B frames used to create each master were re-integrated together using the best "L" frame as integration reference to produce a super-luminance

    ![288 frames integrated together and cropped to produce a super luminance](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step0.Crop.PNG)

* Two Rounds of Dynamic Background Extraction were applied to remove gradients throughout the field

    ![Dynamic Background Extraction](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step1.DBE.PNG)

    ![Dynamic Background Extraction](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step2.DBE.PNG)

    ![After Dynamic Background Extraction](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step2.DBE.After.PNG)


* Independently produce a noise reduced image and a sharpened image 

   * Noise Reduction was done using TGV Denoise with a low contrast mask and an autostretched local support and MMT with a very protective luminance mask

    ![TGV Denoise](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step3.TGV.PNG)

    ![Multiscale Median Transformation](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step4.MMT.PNG)

   * Deconvolution was done on a separate copy of the luminance with

        * No deringing

        * wavelet regularization with 5 layers and strong but reducing amounts/thresholds

    ![Deconvolution with no mask](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step5.Decon.PNG)

    * A combination of starmask and clone stamp was used to produce a series of star masks that together covered all ringing artifacts produced by deconvolution

    ![Combination of Star Masks](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step6.StarMask.PNG)

    ![Deconvolution after Replacing Stars with Starmask and Pixel Math](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step7.Decon.BeforeAndAfter.PNG) 

* The noise reduced copy and the sharpened copy were combined using a luminance-based mask where the high-signal areas were filled in from the deconvolution copy and the low-signal areas were filled in from the noise reduction copy ``Decon*CombineMask+NR*~CombineMask``

    ![Convolved and Clipped Combination Mask](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step8.CombinationMask.PNG)

    ![Combining Noise Reduction with Deconvolution using the Combination Mask](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step9.DeconNRBeforeAndAfter2.PNG)

* The resulting luminance was stretched using Masked Stretch, no clipping, and the same background preview windows aggregated. The tail was brought in using histogram transformation, and the stretch was repeated.

    ![Masked Stretch -> Histogram -> Masked Stretch again -> Histogram](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step10.MaskedStretch.PNG)

* Morphological selection was performed on the stars to reduce their intensity, and Motion Blur Deconvolution was performed on the star cores themselves to correct from the poor guiding performance of the CGEM at this image scale.

    ![Reduce star size/intensity with a contours based star mask and Morphological Selection; Sharpen star cores with Motion Blur deconvolution](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/L.Step11.MorphologicalSelection.DeconStarCores.PNG)

* Two rounds of Local Histogram Equalization was performed to slightly bump the fainter outer regions of NGC3718

[Combination and Final Adjustments]

* The Luminance and the RGB Image was brought together using the LRGB Combination Tool applying the processed/stretched luminance to the processed/stretched RGB images. Chrominance noise reduction was enabled on combination.

    ![Combining Luminance and RGB Together](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/LRGB.Step0.ChannelCombine.PNG)

* Final round of chrominance noise reduction on the stars slight S-Curve to increase the overall contrast. The star cores of the brighter stars were cleaned up with a small amount of convolution and a mask.

    ![Contrast Curve and Bright Star Cleanup](/Deep-Sky/NGC3718/LRGB.Step1.Histogram.SCNR.Curves.PNG)

* An ICC Profile was applied to enable Black Point Compensation
